# Abstract
- What they did in this project?
  - learn language representation of dialects from the process of neural dialect-to-standard normalization models.
  - evaluate the learned representations against traditional dialect divisions
- What is their conclusion in this project?
  - inferred dialect embeddings correlate well with the traditional dialects.

# Introduction
- what model do they use?
  - multilingual neural models
- The task they trained the model on: 
  - dialect-to-standard normalization
- what's their target?
  - study the inferred dialect embeddings produced in the process of normalization tasks
  - with different dimensionality reduction algorithms to see whether the neural normal- ization models learn dialectal differences.
- what's the result?
  - the learned representations correlate well with the traditional dialect classifications
