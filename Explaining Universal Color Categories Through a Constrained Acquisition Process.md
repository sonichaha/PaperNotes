# Abstract
1. Topic: Color categories show cross-cultural similarities
2. Contribution: 
   1. assess the available evidence
   2. suggest an alternative account for the universality of color categories based on linguistic transmission con- strained by universal biases
   3. computational model to test our hypothesis and present results.

# Computational Model of Color Category Acqusition
1. peception of color stimuli
   cielab instead of rgb because rgb is quite remote from human's perception
2. Interaction betweeen agents
   two scenarios: discrimination game and guessing game
