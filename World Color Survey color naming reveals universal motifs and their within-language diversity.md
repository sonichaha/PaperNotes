# Abstract
1. what have they done?
   analyzed the color terms in wcs systems
2. what did they find?
   1. These motifs are universal in that they occur worldwide, with some individual variation, in completely unrelated languages.
   2. The culture a speaker comes from does not completely determine how he or she will use color terms.
   3. The worldwide distribution of the motifs and the cooccurrence of multiple motifs within languages suggest that universal processes control the naming of colors.

# Introduction
1. The first idea they explored:
    that color lexicons occur in only a modest number of distinct, universal color-naming systems, which can be placed in an ordered hierarchy from simple to complex based on the number of categories into which color space is lexically partitioned
   1. how to explore:
   analyzing the wcs data.
      1. result1, color-naming lexicons within 110 languages tend to cluster into a few distinct motifs.
      2. result2, cooccurence of multiple motifs within most languages.
2. The second idea:
   languages ‘‘evolve’’ by adding color names in a relatively fixed sequence.
   result: color terms change over time in a principled way

# Results
1. Cluster Analysis Methodology
   1. K-means cluster analysis of native color terms.
   2. reassembled each informant’s color-naming data into his or her own objectively glossed color-naming system.
   3. K-means analysis to cluster the individual color-naming systems
2. Cluster Analysis Results:
   1. All of the maps display a dominant RED region, and most display a clear YELLOW-OR-ORANGE region, but they vary notably in the partition of the cool region of the WCS chart (corre- sponding to the English terms ‘‘green,’’ ‘‘blue,’’ and ‘‘purple’’).
3. The number of mofits:
   1. most of the variation in color naming among WCS informants is captured in the motifs obtained for K = 3–6
   2. Gap Statistic analysis.
   3. C-index
   4. within-cluster pairwise agreement
4. Universality Across, Diversity Within Languages.
5. Trajectories of Color Term Change. 

# What could be used in our paper
1. compare the universal glosses of human languages and rl agents.
2. dissimilarity between different motifs(color naming systems).
3. derivation of the mofits. and centroids of each networks.
