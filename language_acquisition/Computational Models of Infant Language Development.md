# Abstract
- what are their objectives?
  - evaluation methodologies that could account for robust empirical reference data, help to select representative and consolidated infant data.
  - models with large-scale cumulative empirical data from infants.
- what have they done?
  - formalize the connection between measurable model and human behavior
  - present a conceptual framework for meta-analytic evaluation of computational models
  - exemplify the meta-analytic model evaluation approach with two modeling experiments on infant-directed speech preference and native/non-native vowel discrimination.
