1. Abstract
   1. Objectives: partitioning semantic spaces
   2. Method: multi-agent computational approach, RL
   3. Task: two agents communicate using a finite vocabulary, tested in a color domain
   4. Evaluation: communication efficiency, and resulting partitions of color space.
   5. Conclusion: RL offers a powerful and flexible computational framework that can contribute to the development of communication schemes.
2. Introduction
   1. Topic: word meanings across languages
   2. Related Research: how human manage the effort of communication and understanding; how the management affected by environmental demands; trade-off between communication efficiency and simplicity when shaping languages; maximize the communication efficiency while minimizing cognitive load.
   3. Problem they want to solve:
      1. find computational mechanism to lead to near optimal communicational schemes. - RL
      2. explore trade-offs around communication efficiency.
